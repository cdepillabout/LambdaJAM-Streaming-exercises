Exercise 0
==========

In this exercise we will build a simple variant of the `Stream` data
type and see how it can be used.

Completing this exercise is optional, but may give you a better
understanding of how the Stream data type work.

Tasks
-----

1. Implement `streamToList` and `listToStream`.

2. Augment the `Stream` datatype to add in the ability to have a
   monadic action returning another `Stream`.

3. Implement `foldStream`.

4. Implement monadic mappings.
